# SentimentAnalysis

This is an sentiment analysis model to classify sentiments(1-positive review, 0-negative review) based on imdb movie reviews(dataset courtesy: Stanford). It uses tf-idf property.
Also suitable regularization has been used which increases the accuracy further. Flask frame work is used to implement this model.
A database storing all the inputs(if given by user) is also maintained.
